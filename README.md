# What is WynnArmour?
WynnArmour is a minecraft resourcepack for the server Wynncraft! It aims to bring back the old Armour Skins feature which gave all armour peices there own unquie textures.

# How to help!
If you want to help simply follow the steps below:
## 1. Create your Texture
This can be done in many differant ways depending on if you are making an Icon or an Armour Texture. I reccomend using a resource pack creaotr like Nova Skin: https://minecraft.novaskin.me/resourcepacks
Once you habe made the file donwload it and rename it to a short and concise name. Eg: 'bluemask.png'. Note only have 1 armour peice per file and the file MUST be in .png format.

## 2. Create Your Properties File
The properties file determines when the texture should be used. For your convenience I have made a website that makes them for you: http://aws404.site11.com/propertiesfilecreator. Ensure that all the inputted infomation is correct and up-to-dat. Not: The website is currently new and may have isssues, if you are having trouble message @aws404#7134 on Discord or @aws404 on the Wynncraft Forums.

## 3. Add Them In!
Now just add the .png and .properties into the approrpiate dirrectory in the 'assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit/' dirrecotry. Ensure both files are together or it may not work correctly! Note: I will be moving files around and neatening up how the directories are layed out, please be aware of this and dirrecotries may change.
