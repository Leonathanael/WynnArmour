# What is WynnArmour?
WynnArmour is a Minecraft resource pack for the server Wynncraft! It aims to bring back the old Armour Skins feature which gave all armour pieces their own unquiet textures.

# How to help!
Before adding textures, its best to look around in the files to get an idea for how the organisation works and how the properties files work.  
If you want to help simply follow the steps below:

## 1. Create your Texture
This can be done in many ways, armour textures are generally easier to be made using a website like [Nova Skin](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/resourcepacks) while items can usually be made using a image editor like [PaintDotNet](www.getpaint.net).
Once you have made the file download it and rename it to either 'icon.png' or 'armour.png' depending on the type. Note only have 1 armour piece per file and the file MUST be in .png format.

## 2. Create Your Properties File
The properties file determines when the texture should be used. A good way of doing this is to grab one from the [Documentation](/doc/)'s examples. Ensure that all the inputted information is correct and up-to-date.

## 3. Add Them In!
Now just add the .png and .properties into the appropriate directory including a name accurate to the item you are adding, just follow the folders for the type of item. Ensure both files are together or it will not work correctly!
